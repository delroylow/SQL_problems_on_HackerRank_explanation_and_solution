# Project 3: SQL Problems on HackerRank: Explanation and Solution 

This article aims to provide guidance on solving the SQL problems available on HackerRank. This is not a new idea; however, this article differs in that it explains clearly the strategy to solve each SQL problem using MySQL queries. In addition, the skills or knowledge required in the problem solving process will also be outlined. On top of that, this article provides the MySQL queries required to recreate the sample data set for readers to attempt the problem on their local device and for other SQL practices in the future. This article is merely for educational purpose and it should be served as a guide on solving these problems.
